# spring-boot-measure-execute-time
## Introduction

I recently worked closely with the capacity team, and they have requested the application team to supply data fields related to the "execution time for each transaction." This request aligns with the capacity team's overarching objective of sourcing pertinent data to support analysis, budgeting, resource allocation, and the forecasting of future application growth. The inclusion of transaction execution time is a specific requirement in this context.

Consequently, I have chosen to document my research findings in this blog to address the requirements of the capacity team.
